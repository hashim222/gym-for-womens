# Features #

* ## Header ##

   * I chose bright green as the background color for the header/rgba(0, 247, 0, 0.664) and black/rgb(0, 0, 0) as the color. 
   * When you hover over navigation links, the color changes from black to light black/rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.678), and the underline has a red/rgba(248, 42, 6) color.

* ## Navigation ##

  * Navigation is located in the header section, right corner.
  * There are three links in the navigation: Home, About Us, and Contact Us.
  * The navigation is all on the same page divided into different sections.
  * I made it easier for the user to navigate by adding icons to the navigation.
  * I left under the Home link a red/rgba(248, 42, 6) bottom line to tell the user these are links.
