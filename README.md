# Features #

* ## Header ##

   * I chose bright green as the background color for the header bright green / rgb(0, 247, 0, 0.664) and black / rgb(0, 0, 0) as the color. 
   * When you hover over navigation links, the color changes from black to light black / rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.678), and the underline has a red / rgb(248, 42, 6) color.

* ## Navigation ##

  * Navigation is located in the header section, right corner.
  * There are three links in the navigation: Home, About Us, and Contact Us.
  * The navigation is all on the same page divided into different sections.
  * I made it easier for the user to navigate by adding icons to the navigation.
  * I left under the Home link a red / rgb(248, 42, 6) bottom line to tell the user these are links.
  * When you scroll down the page, the navigation remains at the top of the page, making it easier for the user to get to the top of the page rather than scrolling at the top.
