## Font Used For UX

* ### There are three font styles used throughout this site:  

   For the header and navigation bar, I used the ["Anton" font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton).

   ![this is an image for Anton font style](assets/images/readme-images/anton-font.png)

   Throughout the page, there are some places I used ["Krona" font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Krona+One).

   ![this is an image for Krona font style](assets/images/readme-images/korona-font.png)

  For some of the footer section, I used ["Fredoka" font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka+One).

  ![this is an image for fredoka font style](assets/images/readme-images/fredoka-font.png)

# Features

* ### Header 
  * A header is located at the top of the page, with a logo and navigation inside.

    ![this is an image is for header](assets/images/readme-images/header-for-gym.png)

  * To make the text look different, the logo was intentionally placed on the left side of the screen for smaller devices rather than in the middle.

    ![this is an image for how gym for women logo looks for smaller devices](assets/images/readme-images/smaller-device-header.png)

* ### Logo

  * The name of the gym is displayed in the left corner of the header.
  * Also, it's the logo for the gym for women. It links to the top of the page.

    ![this is an image for gym for women logo](assets/images/readme-images/header-page-logo.png)
  
* ### Navigation 

  * Navigation is located in the header section, right corner of desktops and for the smaller screen is located in the center.
  * There are three links in the navigation: Home, About Us, and Contact Us.
  * All navigation sections are linked on the same page but are separated into different sections.
  * I made it easier for the user to navigate by adding icons to the navigation.
  * I used the red border-bottom under the home button to tell the user these are links.
  * When you scroll down the page, the navigation remains at the top of the page, making it easier for the user to get to the top of the page rather than scrolling at the top.


    ![this is an image for navigation for gym for women](assets/images/readme-images/nav-for-gym.png)

* ### Home page
  * The main section of the website contains white text above the images to attract the users' attention and indicate that the text is important.

  * This section contains two images that are grouped, with The left image took up 40% of the width, while the right image took up 60% of the width. This was done on purpose so visitors can see more of what the gym has to offer such as the gym equipments.

    ![this is an image home page section](assets/images/readme-images/home-page-section.png)
   
* ### Welcome User section 
  * With this section, we wanted to greet our users and welcome new users with a bonus.
  * In the box it clearly states that a new gym member will receive a 10% discount on their first month's membership, along with the price of the monthly membership.
  * To encourage users to join our gym, an image of our indoor main workout area was added.

    ![this is an image for welcoming new customer](assets/images/readme-images/welcome-gym.png)

* ### Our Classes
  * To ensure our users are aware of our weekly classes so they can attend, I added large text to our weekly classes.
  * Added multiple images so that our users know what to expect in our weekly classes.

    ![this is an image for our weekly classes](assets/images/readme-images/fittnes-classes.png)

 * ### About Us
    * Upon clicking the about us link at the top of the navigation page, you will be directed to a section about us.
    * I want users to know what we're about before they join our gym by providing this page.

      ![this is an image for our about us](assets/images/readme-images/abt-us-image.png)

    * By joining our gym, the user will have access to a variety of facilities and can participate in many different types of workouts.

      ![this is an image for our facilities for gym](assets/images/readme-images/our-facilities.png)


  * ### Contact Us
    * The contact us link at the top of the navigation page will take you to the contact us section, where you will find the form.
    * The contact us section was created for users with any questions/enquiries about the gym. 
    * In this section, users will fill out the form by entering their personal information.

      ![this is an image for contact us page for a site](assets/images/readme-images/contact-us.png)

  * ###  Submit Form

    * When the user tries to submit a form without providing the required details, a pop-up required text will appear, telling them to fill that required details.

      ![this is an image requird warning](assets/images/readme-images/required-image.png)

    * The user will be taken to a thank you page after completing the form and clicking on the submit button.

      ![this is an image submit button](assets/images/readme-images/submit-form.png)
      
      ![this is an image thank you page](assets/images/readme-images/thank-u-readme.png)

   * ### Footer Section

      * In the footer, I added three nested sub-sections for our opening hours, contacts, and social media.
      * By checking our opening hours, users can find out when we are open.
      * Contact support provides email and phone numbers as well as our location. If you want to register with us, you can either visit us in person or do it online by filling out our contact us form.
      * Users can follow us on these social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tiktok.

        ![this is an image for footer section](assets/images/readme-images/footer-section.png)
 

   * ### Home Page
     * I also stick navigation on top of the page by using [position: sticky](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_sticky_element.asp) which sticks elements where you want them to be.

     * When the user scrolls down the page, the navigation remains at the top of the page. This makes it easier for the user to get to the top of the page rather than scrolling at the top. This is done by simply clicking the home button or gym logo.
