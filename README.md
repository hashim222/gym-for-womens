# GYM FOR WOMEN 

## introduction
The Gym for Women site was designed for women from diverse backgrounds who are uncomfortable in mixed gyms.

The website of GYM FOR WOMEN provides all the information users need about this gym: welcome for new customers, a joining discount for first-time customers, our weekly fitness classes, how to contact us, our opening and closing hours, where to find us, and finally, how to follow us on social media.

# Font Used For UX

## There are three font styles used throughout this site:

* ### For the header and navigation bar, I used the ["Anton" font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton).

* ### Throughout the page, there are some places I used ["Krona" font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Krona+One).

* ### For some of the footer section, I used ["Fredoka" font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka+One).

  * A header is located at the top of the page, with a logo and navigation inside.

* ## Logo

  * The name of the gym is displayed in the left corner of the header.
  * Also, it's the logo for the gym for women. It links to the top of the page.

* ## Navigation 

  * Navigation is located in the header section, right corner.
  * There are three links in the navigation: Home, About Us, and Contact Us.
  * All navigation sections are on the same page, but are separated into different sections.
  * I made it easier for the user to navigate by adding icons to the navigation.
  * I left under the Home link a red bottom line to tell the user these are links.
  * When you scroll down the page, the navigation remains at the top of the page, making it easier for the user to get to the top of the page rather than scrolling at the top.

* ## Main Page 
  * On the page, I added a long line below the big welcome text for users to make the text look clearer.
  * We provide our users with a clear monthly price and 10% off for joining our gym when they join.
  * To encourage users to join, an image of our indoor main workout area was added.

* ## Our Classes
  * Through our classes, we ensure that our users are aware of our weekly classes so they are able to attend.
  * Added multiple images so that our users know what to expect in our weekly classes.

 * ## About Us
    * Upon clicking the about us link at the top of the navigation page, you will be directed to a section about us.
    * This page lets users know what we are about before they join our gym.
