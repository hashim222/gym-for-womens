## Font Used For UX

* ### There are three font styles used throughout this site:  

   For the header and navigation bar, I used the ["Anton" font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton).

   ![this is an image for Anton font style](assets/images/readme-images/anton-font.png)

   Throughout the page, there are some places I used ["Krona" font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Krona+One).

   ![this is an image for Krona font style](assets/images/readme-images/korona-font.png)

  For some of the footer section, I used ["Fredoka" font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka+One).

# Features

* ### Header 
  * A header is located at the top of the page, with a logo and navigation inside.

    ![this is an image is for header](assets/images/readme-images/header-for-gym.png)

* ### Logo

  * The name of the gym is displayed in the left corner of the header.
  * Also, it's the logo for the gym for women. It links to the top of the page.


    ![this is an image for gym for women logo](assets/images/readme-images/header-page-logo.png)

* ### Navigation 

  * Navigation is located in the header section, right corner.
  * There are three links in the navigation: Home, About Us, and Contact Us.
  * All navigation sections are on the same page, but are separated into different sections.
  * I made it easier for the user to navigate by adding icons to the navigation.
  * I left under the Home link a red bottom line to tell the user these are links.
  * When you scroll down the page, the navigation remains at the top of the page, making it easier for the user to get to the top of the page rather than scrolling at the top.

* ### Main Page 
  * With this section, we wanted to greet our users and welcome new users with a bonus.
  * The chart clearly shows that our new member of gym will receive a 10% discount on their first month's membership and that the monthly fee is clearly stated.
  * To encourage users to join our gym, an image of our indoor main workout area was added.

    ![this is an image for welcoming new customer](assets/images/readme-images/welcome-gym.png)

* ### Our Classes
  * To ensure our users are aware of our weekly classes so they can attend, I added large text to our weekly classes.
  * Added multiple images so that our users know what to expect in our weekly classes.

    ![this is an image for our weekly classes](assets/images/readme-images/fittnes-classes.png)

 * ### About Us
    * Upon clicking the about us link at the top of the navigation page, you will be directed to a section about us.
    * We want users to know what we're about before they join our gym by providing this page.
    * Once the user joins our gym, they can access to variety of different facilities.
    * Users can take advantage of these facilities whenever they want to visit the gym.

  * ### Contact Us
    * The contact us link at the top of the navigation page will take you to the contact us section, where you will find the form.
    *  The contact us section was created for users with any questions/enquiries about the gym. 
    * In this section, users will fill out the form by entering their personal information.

      ![this is an image for contact us page for a site](assets/images/readme-images/contact-us.png)

  * ###  Submit Form

    * When the user tries to submit a form without providing the required details, a pop-up required text will appear, telling them to fill that required details.
    * The user will be taken to a thank you page after completing the form and clicking on the submit button.

   * ### Footer Section

      * In the footer, I added three nested sub-sections for our opening hours, contacts, and social media.
      * By checking our opening hours, users can find out when we are open.
      * Contact support provides email and phone numbers as well as our location. If you want to register with us, you can either visit us in person or do it online by filling out our contact us form.
      * Users can follow us on these social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tiktok.

        ![this is an image for footer section](assets/images/readme-images/footer-section.png)
 

   * ### Home Page
     * I also stuck navigation on top of the page by using [position: sticky](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_sticky_element.asp) which sticks elements where you want them to be.

     * When the user scrolls down the page, the navigation remains at the top of the page. This makes it easier for the user to get to the top of the page rather than scrolling at the top. This is done by simply clicking the home button or gym logo.

## Credits

 * ### Content
   * Font Awesome provided a kit that didn't work, so I had to use the [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome) site to make font awesome work.
   * I used [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to create icons for this website.
   * By using the [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/) site, I used font-family and a few [google icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
